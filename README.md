# Python Concepts for Novices

Welcome to the guide for essential Python concepts! This document provides a brief overview of topics to help you understand key programming principles. Each topic is further organized in individual folders with detailed explanations and examples.

## Variable Scope

Variable scope determines where a variable can be accessed in your code. It can be:

- **Local**: Accessible only within the function it is declared.
- **Global**: Accessible throughout the entire script.
- **Nonlocal**: Allows access to variables in an enclosing function's scope.

## Testing

Testing ensures your code works as intended. Key types include:

- **Unit Testing**: Tests individual components.
- **Integration Testing**: Tests interactions between components.
- **Tools**: Python offers libraries like `unittest` and `pytest`.

## Error Handling

Handle errors gracefully using:

- `try`, `except` blocks to catch exceptions.
- `finally` for cleanup operations.
- `raise` to generate custom exceptions.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP focuses on organizing code using objects. Key concepts:

- **Classes** and **Objects**: Define and instantiate blueprints.
- **Encapsulation**: Restrict access to some components.
- **Abstraction**: Hide implementation details.
- **Inheritance**: Derive new classes from existing ones.
- **Polymorphism**: Use a unified interface for different types.

## MySQL

Use Python to interact with MySQL databases:

- Install `mysql-connector` or `SQLAlchemy`.
- Perform CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
- Write SQL queries within Python scripts.

## Modules

Modules are reusable pieces of Python code. You can:

- Import built-in modules like `math`, `os`, or `random`.
- Create custom modules for specific functionalities.
- Use `pip` to install third-party modules.

## Inheritance and Polymorphism

- **Inheritance**: Share methods and attributes across classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Implement methods differently in derived classes, enhancing flexibility.

## Functions

Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks. Key types:

- **Built-in Functions**: `len()`, `print()`, etc.
- **User-Defined Functions**: Custom functions using the `def` keyword.
- **Anonymous Functions**: Lambda expressions for short, simple tasks.

## Data Structures

Python provides built-in data structures to store and manipulate data:

- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections.
- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections.
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs.
- **Sets**: Unordered, unique elements.

## Classes

Classes are templates for creating objects. Define with the `class` keyword:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def display(self):
        print(self.value)
```

## Decorators

Decorators modify the behavior of functions or methods:

- Use the `@decorator_name` syntax.
- Examples: `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, `@property`.
