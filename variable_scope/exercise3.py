Exercise 3: Scope Hierarchy Instructions: 

* Define a variable in the global scope, 
then create a function with an enclosing scope that redefines a variable with the same name.

 * Inside this function, access both the global and enclosing variables and print their values. 

 * Discuss with comments in the code how Python follows the LEGB rule for variable lookup.
